# Motivation

Agent-based models like have **long simulation run-times** and **large numbers of unknown input parameters**, making them difficult to calibrate with iterative sampling-based algorithms

-   Highly irregular, multi-dimensional goodness-of-fit space: local optimum "traps"\
-   Curse of dimensionality: \# of evaluations needed scales *exponentially* with \# parameters

These issues are compounded when there are multiple fitting objectives.

# Methods

Inspired by [previous work](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27486-z) done to recalibrate *Openmalaria*, we used a Gaussian process emulator to drastically reduce the number of simulations that actually have to be run during calibration.
